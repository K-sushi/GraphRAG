    "response": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how we live and work.  It involves machine learning algorithms that are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing computers to identify patterns, predict outcomes, and find solutions to complex problems.  Deep learning, a subset of machine learning using neural networks, has been particularly revolutionary in areas like computer vision and natural language processing (though the provided context doesn't elaborate on what those are).  In healthcare, AI is powering diagnostic tools that improve the speed and accuracy of disease detection.",
