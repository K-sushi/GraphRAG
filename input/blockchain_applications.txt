Blockchain technology extends beyond cryptocurrency applications. Supply chain management uses blockchain to track products from origin to consumer, ensuring authenticity and preventing counterfeiting. Digital identity verification leverages blockchain to create tamper-proof identity records. Smart contracts automate business processes without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms enable lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional banks. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) create unique digital ownership for art, music, and virtual assets. Enterprise blockchain solutions are being adopted by companies like Walmart, JP Morgan, and Maersk to improve transparency and reduce fraud. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are being explored by governments worldwide as alternatives to physical cash.
